Read below some comments about what you will find in ShowtimeLab.

### Language ###
The project uses a combination of UIKit, Combine, and SwiftUI.

### Unit Tests ###
Some Unit tests were included

### Comments ###
Attempts to use an ordinary SwiftUI Image failed with an invalid JSON error so I used a web view instead.
Overall, there's plenty here that I would refine with more time.  
My Xcode version is old because of my older macbook pro & Catalina V 10.15.7.
I believe newer Xcode will prompt you to click a button to convert the project.
